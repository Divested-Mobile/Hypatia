Features
--------
- Near zero battery impact: you'll never notice any impact on battery at all
- Extremely fast: it can scan small files (1MB) in <20ms, and even large files (40MB) in 1000ms.
- Memory efficient: with the default databases enabled it uses under 120MB.
- Regular scan: allowing selection of /system, internal storage, external storage, and installed apps
- Realtime scanner: can detect malware in realtime on write/rename in internal storage
- Completely offline: Internet is only used to download signature databases, files will never ever leave your device
- Persistence: will automatically restart on boot/update
- Tiny codebase: coming in at under 1000 sloc, it can be audited by even someone with basic programming experience
- Minimal dependencies: the app only uses libraries when necessary
- Signature databases can be enabled/disabled at the users demand

Technical Details
------------------
- Signature databases are ClamAV .hdb (MD5 hashes) and .hsb (SHA-1/SHA-256) format
- Signature databases will not be redownloaded if the file hasn't changed on the server (304 not modified)
- Signatures are stored using HashMaps for O(1) lookup
- Files have their MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256 hashes calculated in one pass
- Realtime scanner is multithreaded and will use half of the device's core count for scanning multiple files asynchronously
- Realtime scanning powered by a recursive FileObserver
- Network connections will be made to the following: https://divested.dev/MalwareScannerSignatures/*.h*b.gz

- Custom database support
- Automatic database updates
- Automatic database generation
- Client side database generation
- Database signature verification
- Database sanity checks
- Testing
- Better GUI
- Translations
- Scanning entire system using root (low priority)

Goals
-----
